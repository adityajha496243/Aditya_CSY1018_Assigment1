              <h1>CSS Grid Layout</h1>
              <p>CSS Grid Layout (otherwise known as "Lattice"), is a two-dimensional matrix based format framework that expects to do nothing not exactly totally change the manner in which we plan network based UIs. CSS has dependably been utilized to spread out our website pages, however it's never completed a generally excellent activity of it. In the first place, we utilized tables, at that point buoys, situating and inline-square, yet these strategies were basically hacks and forgotten a great deal of significant usefulness (vertical focusing, for example). Flexbox assisted, however it's expected for more straightforward one-dimensional designs, not intricate two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid really work very well together). Framework is the absolute first CSS module made explicitly to tackle the format issues we've all been hacking our way around for whatever length of time that we've been making sites.<br><br> 

              There are two essential things that propelled me to make this guide. The first is Rachel Andrew's wonderful book Get Ready for CSS Grid Layout. It's a careful, clear prologue to Grid and is the premise of this whole article. I exceedingly urge you to get it and read it. My other enormous motivation is Chris Coyier's A Complete Guide to Flexbox, which has been my go-to asset for everything flexbox. It's helped a huge amount of individuals, obvious by the way that it's the top outcome when you Google "flexbox." You'll see numerous likenesses between his post and mine, since why not take from the best?<br><br> 

              My expectation with this guide is to introduce the Grid ideas as they exist in the most recent variant of the detail. So I won't cover the outdated IE linguistic structure, and I'll do my best to refresh this guide routinely as the spec develops.</p>

              <h1>CSS Flexbox Layout</h1>
              <p>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").<br><br>

              The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.<br><br>

              Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).<br><br>

              Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.</p>

          <p>Responsive web design is a great solution to our multi-screen problem, but getting into it from the print perspective is difficult. No fixed page size, no millimetres or inches, no physical constraints to fight against. Designing in pixels for Desktop and Mobile only is also the past, as more and more gadgets can open up a website. Therefore, let's clarify some basic principles of responsive web design here to embrace the fluid web, instead of fighting it. To keep it simple we'll focus on layouts (yes, responsive goes way deeper than that and if you want to learn more this is a good start).</p>
